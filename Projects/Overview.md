# Our Projects
## Detection and Analysis of Calcifications in Breast Mamographies (Z. Wang)

- Calcification count and type is an important criterion for breast cancer diagnosis but it is done manually due to the complexity of breast tissue

## Circardian Rhythm in Neuron Cells
Fluorescence signal in neuron cells in the region of the brain responsible for circadian regulation

- Dataset and Kernels on https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/circadian-rhythm-in-the-brain

### Questions

 - Do the cells move during the experiment?
 - How regular is their signal? 
  - Is the period 24 hours?
 - Do nearby cells oscillate together?
 - Do they from chunks or groups, over what range do they work?
 - Are there networks formed from time-precedence?


# Kaggle Projects

## Right Whale Identification


- All information copied from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/noaa-right-whale-recognition)

```
Currently, only a handful of very experienced researchers can identify individual whales on sight while out on the water. For the majority of researchers, identifying individual whales takes time, making it difficult to effectively target whales for biological samples, acoustic recordings, and necessary health assessments.
```

Example whale image to identify:

## Heart Ejection Fraction from MRI: Data Science Bowl 

- All information copied from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/second-annual-data-science-bowl)

The goal is to automatically measure the ejection fraction of a heart using 4D (3D + time) images of the heart. There are over 17GB of images to analyze and a few hints on the forums on how to use analytical (Fourier method) and Deep Learning approaches.

## Digit Recognizer
- Can digits be accurately identified from images?
- [Automated identification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer) is important for thousands of applications from traffic control to reciept validation.
- Number of solutions already [available](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/prospector)
